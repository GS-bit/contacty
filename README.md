Contact books are useful lists of contacts containing their identification (usually the name) and some of their basic information (phone number, address, etc). Contacty is an elegant and pleasable contact book management system available for Linux, allowing the user to create and access several contact books, deciding what contacts to add, edit, delete and move in the list. The software features some resources that improve the user experience, including the possibilities to search contacts and sort them.
